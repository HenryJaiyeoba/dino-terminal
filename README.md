## Introduction

If you're not familiar with the popular Dino Chrome game which surprisingly eases tension during a marathon coding session, then you might be living under a rock. 
However, I'm here to introduce you to Dino-Terminal. Don't worry too much, you guessed right: It's the same Dino game (with more features of course), but in the terminal.
