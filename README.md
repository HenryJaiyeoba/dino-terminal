## Introduction

If you're not familiar with the popular Dino Chrome game which surprisingly eases tension during a marathon coding session, then you might be living under a rock. However, I'm here to introduce you to Dino-Terminal. Don't worry too much, you guessed right: It's the same Dino game (with more features of course), but in the terminal. 

Dino-Terminal is a simple dino game that is built on the mastery of manipulating your terminal.
Here's what we don't want: The common dino longing for an affection outside Chrome.

## Installation
To install, simply ```pip install dino-terminal``` 

## How to play the game
- Press the space bar key to jump over obstacles
- Press the down arrow key (â†“) to duck beneath hovering obstacles

## Possible Updates
This project is a fun project to learn about manipulating strings on the terminal and is based on the curses library. Here are some possible updates to improve the game:

- Include easter eggs.
- Include randomly generated flying birds to duck below.
- Train an AI model to successfully play the game without losing.
